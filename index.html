 <h1 class="Information" > About Me </h1> 
<p>Hi, my name is Eduardo Ruiz. I am a Senior at the University of Nebraska at Omaha,I am 23 years old. I am working on my degree in Management Information Systems.I attended St. Peter Claver Cristo Rey Catholic High School (SPC) for my first two years of high school. Later I had to transfer to Ralston High School due to SPC shutting down because of funds.My transition from SPC to Ralston High School was a bit difficult as SPC was a college-prep school and Ralston was a public high school. I feel that SPC was more challenging than Ralston and pushed me more to complete my assignments,preparing me for college.</p>
SPC was only open for four years, due to being in debt, they were forced to shutdown. They were only able to graduate one class-- my cousin was one of their graduates.</p>

<h1 class="Information" >Recreation</h1>

<p>I like to do a lot of things on my  free time. Some of those things include playing soccer,baseball,football, and lastly being a gear head. I drive a Subaru Impreza WRX-STI.I go from 0-60 in less than 4 seconds, working on cars and motorcycles are my biggests hobbies/passions.</p>

<p> As of right now my favorite sport would be baseball, however I don't have a lot of friends that enjoy baseball, so most of the time I play soccer. I like soccer just about the same as baseball. I play pick up soccer for now as I don't have the time to dedicate to a team at the moment. </p>
